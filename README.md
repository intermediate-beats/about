# About Intermediate BEATS
## Overview
- Intermediate BEATS is a library of information that its authors deemed relevant to using particular musical tools.
- The information is currently contained in markdown files in repositories.
- The repositories are currently organized by manufacturer.
- The devices are organized within repositories in individual directories (folders).
- The authors, except where explicity stated, have zero affiliation with any particular manufacturer.
- Anyone who has a cool tip about a piece of gear is encouraged to file a PR.
- Anyone who thinks there is some messed up info in here is encouraged to file an issue.
- Do not be afraid to make mistakes. Mistakes are key to learning, and learning is what we're all about.

## Style Guide
- Name files with kebab case (it's easier to type).
- One manufacturer per repo.
- One directory per device unless devices are comparable enough (say, 80%+ similar) to share docs.
- Main device page ("home") has the same name as parent directory.
- Main README.md links to all child device pages.
- We are trying to reduce friction and optimize for ease and accessibility. If you think anything we are doing here gets in the way of that, please let us know.
